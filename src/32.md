# With 32
    These 32 paths are manifest as the 10 digits and the 22 letters of the Hebrew aphabet. The 10 digits are also manifest in the Ten Sefirot, which are the most basic concepts of existence.

    The letters and digits are the basis of the most basic ingredients of creation, quality and quantity. The qualities of any given thing can be described by words formed out of the letters, while all of its associated quantities can be expressed by numbers.

    Numbers, however, cannot be defined until there exists some element of plurality in creation. The Creator Himself is absolutely simple, containing no plurality whatsoever. He is the most absolute unity imaginable. Therefore, plurality only came into existence with the advent of creation. Only then could numbers be defined (quantified).

    The first elements of plurality in creation involved the Ten Sefirot. Hence, it was the Sefirot that defined the numbers, and therefore, the concept of quantity in general.
